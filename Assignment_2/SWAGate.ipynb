    "# Problem Set - [SWAP Gate](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.SwapGate.html)\n",
    "The goal of this problem set is to learn about the usage of the SWAP gate. As the name suggests, the SWAP gate swaps the states of two qubits. The SWAP gate is a two-qubit gate and can be represented as follows:\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "Of course, you are not required at this point to know about how a matrix works. The SWAP gate is a reversible gate, meaning that it can be undone by applying the same gate again. This is a very useful property of the SWAP gate, as it allows us to undo the effect of the SWAP gate on a quantum state."
