    "# Problem Set - Hadamard Gate\n",

The Hadamard gate is a single qubit gate that maps the computational basis states to the equal superposition of the computational basis states. It is a unitary gate, and is represented by the matrix:\n",

    "It will allow us to move away from the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ and into the superposition states $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$ and $|\\phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$."

This is the same as the state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$. **In English this means that it will have a 50% chance to measure $|0\\rangle$ and a 50% chance to measure $|1\\rangle$.** This is the same as the state $|\\phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$.\n",

This is a very useful property, and we can use it to create a random number generator. The idea is that we will apply the Hadamard gate to many qubits, and then measure them.
