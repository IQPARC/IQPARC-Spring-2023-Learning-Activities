# IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities
### Lesson 1: Introduction to Quantum Circuit
In the first activity we will learn about how to setup the basic quantum circuit and simulate it. There are 4 problems in [assignment 0](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_0) that you must complete prior to the next club meeting.

### Lesson 2: Introduction to Single Qubit Gates
In the seconed less we will go over the single qubit gates and their usages. There are 2 problem sets in [assignment 1](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_1) you must complete prior to the next meeting and submit to discord.
