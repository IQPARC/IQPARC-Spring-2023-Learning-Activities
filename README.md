# IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities
### Lesson 1: Introduction to Quantum Circuit
In the first activity we will learn about how to setup the basic quantum circuit and simulate it. There are 4 problems in [assignment 0](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_0) that you must complete prior to the next club meeting.

### Lesson 2: Introduction to Single Qubit Gates
In the [seconed lesson](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/blob/main/Lecture/SingleQubitGates.ipynb) we will go over the single qubit gates and their usages. There are 2 problem sets in [assignment 1](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_1) you must complete prior to the next meeting and submit to discord.

### Lesson 3 + 4: Multi-Qubit Gates
In the [third lesson](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/blob/main/Lecture/MultipleQubitGatesPart1.ipynb) and [fourth lesson](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/blob/main/Lecture/MultiQubitGatesPart2.ipynb) we will go over the few most common multi-qubit gates and their usages. There are 2 problems each in [assignment 2](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_2) and in [assignment 3](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_3). Please remember to submit your assignments to discord.

### Running your code on Microsoft Azure
Please contact Anderson Xu (xu1464@purdue.edu) to get invited to the Purdue IQPARC Microsoft Azure Quantum Workspace. Upload [this](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/blob/main/Lecture/QiskitTest.ipynb) file to the workspace and run to see how to run Qiskit on Azure.

### Lesson 5: Grover's Algorithm
In the [fifth lesson](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/blob/main/Lecture/Grover's%20Algorithm.ipynb) we will combine everything we have learned so far and discuss our first quantum algorithm! Please go through the notebook and try out the practice questions at the end of the document as well.
