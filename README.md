# IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities
### Lesson 1: Introduction to Quantum Circuit
In the first activity we will learn about how to setup the basic quantum circuit and simulate it. There are 4 problems in [assignment 0](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_0) that you must complete prior to the next club meeting.

### Lesson 2: Introduction to Single Qubit Gates
In the [seconed lesson](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/blob/main/Lecture/SingleQubitGates.ipynb) we will go over the single qubit gates and their usages. There are 2 problem sets in [assignment 1](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_1) you must complete prior to the next meeting and submit to discord.

### Lesson 3: Introduction to Multi-Qubit Gates
In the third lesson we will go over a few multi-qubit gates and their usages. There are 3 problems in [assignment 2](https://github.com/IQPARC/IQPARC-Spring-2023-Learning-Activities/tree/main/Assignment_2). Please remember to submit your assignments to discord.
